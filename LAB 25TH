Permissions:
Every file, directory, and other system objects in Linux are assigned an owner and a group. This is the most basic, yet essential, part of system security that protects users from each other. Owners, users belonging to a group, and all others may be granted different types of access to read from, write to, or execute files. This is generally referred to as file permissions in Linux.

To set permissions and manage ownership, we will use the following commands:

-chmod: change file permissions

-chown: change file owner

-chgrp: change group ownership

-id: print user and group IDs

Users, Groups, and Everyone Else
Typically, the owner of a file is the user who created it and (at least initially) the group is the one associated with the owner (also known as primary group).

To illustrate,a new file called test1 in the current working directory:

echo "This is a dummy file called test1" > test1
